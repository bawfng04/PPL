ASSIGNMENT 2
Version 1.0
After completing this assignment, you will be able to
• explain the stucture of parser generated by ANTLR
• manipulate (traverse, create) on tree, which has different types of node, using Visitor
• write a short program in Python to generate intermediate code (AST) for a valid MiniGo
program.

Specification

A parser will check if the input is grammatically correct or not. If the input is grammatically
wrong, an error message is released. This is what you did in the assignment 1. In the case the
input is grammatically correct, an intermediate code is generated. This is the requirement of
this assignment. As AST is selected to be the intermediate code, you are required to write an
AST generator for a program written in MiniGo. To complete this assignment, you need to
watch the lecture of AST to:
• investigate the structure of a parser generated by ANTLR
• try to find out how to generate an AST from a parse tree.
• investigate the AST classes defined in Python.
• modify ASTGenerator.py to generate an AST.
• check your code to make sure it right.
To complete this assignment, you need to:
• download initial code (assignment2.zip) and unzip it.
• copy your MiniGo.g4, your solution of assignment 1, into folder src/main/minigo/parser.
• have a look at folder src/main/minigo/utils in the code of assignment 2 where there are 2
files AST.py and Visitor.py. In these two files, just only AST.py is used in this assignment
while the other file will be used in the next one. AST.py defines all classes in AST which
is the output of this assignment. You are NOT allowed to modify all these files.
• modify ASTGenerator.py in folder src/main/minigo/astgen to generate AST from a parse
tree, i.e. the result of assignment 1, generated from ANTLR.
• modify ASTGenSuite.py in folder src/test/ to create 100 tests in total for this assignment.

Submissions

This assignment requires you submit your code in 3 files: MiniGo.g4, ASTGenerator.py and
ASTGenSuite.py. MiniGo.g4 is often modified to complete this assignment but even when it is
not modified, it must also be submitted.
All the testcases for this assignment are correctly grammatically correct. You are required to
submit just only 3 files MiniGo.g4, ASTGenerator.py and ASTGenSuite.py, which must have
100 different tests. Note that you must NOT compress your files when submit them.
You must complete the assignment by yourself and do not let your work seen by someone else
as well as do not use the work of someone else as your work, otherwise, you will be punished
by the university rule for plagiarism.
